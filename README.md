## Philosophy

Flat Cap draws inspiration from the fantastic design logic of the **[Nord theme](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord)**, embracing its principles of calm, clean aesthetics, and a dimmed pastel color approach. However, Flat Cap diverges significantly in its color palette, which is uniquely derived from the visual language of the latest **Horizon OS** iterations by Meta for Oculus Quest. This fusion results in a theme that is both familiar in its minimalist comfort and fresh in its distinct, modern color scheme.

## Color Palette

The Flat Cap theme is built upon a carefully curated and expanded color palette, designed for granular control and visual harmony across various UI elements and syntax highlighting. The palette is divided into four main categories: Deep Twilight, Dawnlight, Ocean Blues, and Vivid Accents.

### Ocean Blues (Primary UI Components & Syntax)

The core of the palette, used for key UI components and code syntax, now with a more noticeable tonal progression.

- **FlatCap 10**: `#6b7f8e` - Darker grayish-blue, for less prominent syntax elements or informational UI.

### Vivid Accents (States & Special Syntax)

Used to indicate various states (error, warning, success) and to highlight specific syntax elements.

## Recommended Settings

For the best experience, I recommend using a font that supports ligatures, such as **Fira Code** or **JetBrains Mono**. You can enable ligatures in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code', 'JetBrains Mono', Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```
